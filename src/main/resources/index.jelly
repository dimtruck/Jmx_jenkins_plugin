  This plugin integrates JMX data into your Jenkins build.<br/>
  A performance test for a Java application should be run during build time and data is collected to a specific location via a jmx integration tool (ala jmxtrans). After the build, the performance statistics will be loaded from generated jmx file and shown in the Jenkins interface.
