Jmx_jenkins_plugin
==================

Plugin to view jmx output in Jenkins

**WHAT**
This plugin is based on <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/performance-plugin/">Performance Plugin</a> built to collect jmx data generated by <a href="https://github.com/jmxtrans/jmxtrans">jmxtrans</a> tool.  This tool hooks into a running jvm and exposes jmx data in a variety of formats.  One of those formats is <a href="https://github.com/jmxtrans/jmxtrans/wiki/KeyOutWriter">Key out writer</a>, which spits data out in a tab-delimited format.  The user must complete the following steps for the plugin to work:
<ul>
<ol>Add plugin as post-build step</ol>
<ol>Specify the path to the output file in the plugin configuration</ol>
<ol>Start java application with jmxtrans added in the startup arguments and jmxtrans json file specifying the output as KeyOutWriter</ol>
</ul>

Once the test completes, the data is published into the jenkins output.

**WHY**
Most performance-based plugins only capture response times.  There's a need to also expose internal perfmon data.  JMX is a great way to do it.

**DEPENDENCIES**
